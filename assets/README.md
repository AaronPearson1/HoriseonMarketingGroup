Horiseon Marketing Group

The scope of this project entailed working to enhance accessability on a webpage for Horiseon Marketing Group. 

The criteria of acceptance included the following:
1.Semantic Elements within the source code
2.Elements that follow logical structure, independent of styling and positioning
3.Accesible alt attributes within the image elements
4.Heading attributes that are in sequential order
5.A concise, descriptive title

HTML

Semantic elements were added to replace all div tags. As it relates to the span tag, the logic here was to keep it as a generic inline container given the text "seo", within the header h1 "Horiseon", only required a change in color.

Elements for the most part followed a logical structure throughout the web page. In terms of the main tag used after section, the decsion here was made due to the bulk of content below the hero.

Alt attributes were added to the refenced images to ensure enhancements in accessability as well as satifsfy critea. 

H1, H2, H3, and H4 elements are in sequential order throughout the webpage. 

The generic title was changed to Horiseon Marketing Group to reflect the unique reopositry created as well as to match the directory name.

CSS

As it relates to CSS, I was able to consolidate the main section by finding similarites in the Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing groups and creating the classes of content-group, content-group img, content-group h2. The same apporoach was taken for the aside section which inluded Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management; the class created for this section was benefit-group, benefit group h3, benefit-group img.
